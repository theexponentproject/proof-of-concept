# Proof of Concept

# Introduction

The Exponent Project leverages the power of decentralization and social referrals to push the limits of what the Internet and social networking can do to solve broad, time-critical problems using timely communication, wide-area team-buliding, and urgent mobilization. 

This directory holds the proof of concept developed for Impact Summit in June 2018. The structure of the project is based on Query Incentive Networks.
 	 
 # Use Cases	

* Finding children
* Searching for outlaws
* Responding to a humanitarian crisis
